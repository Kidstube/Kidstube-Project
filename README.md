In today’s world everyone is using smartphones and apps even small children’s uses apps like YouTube to watch funny videos and cartoons. YouTube has created a special app for kids known as YouTube Kids where there is content for small kids like cartoons and videos but the flaw in this app is that anybody can sign up and upload videos which may be irrelevant or not good for child to watch and there are multiple advertisements which is irrelevant to children and there is no time limit option for parents. In our project we will create such an app for children in which these all flaws will be covered and we will also add other features like if a child is viewing a cartoon for 2 hours he must have to watch some religious or ethical videos and there will be no advertisements which are irrelevant to children.Our prime objective is to create a platform where children can enjoy videos which are relevant and good for them and which will also help in their right growth since there is religious and ethical content as well in assistance with parents.
The purpose of this project is to provide a particular platform in which a child of below 7 age can easily spend their time watching certain things on the app without parents’ guide. This document will specify the feasibility study to the requirements analysis of the project with particular flow model in order to make things understandable.
The scope of this project defines the fulfillments of parents need and to satisfy them with such a thing on which they can blindly trust and let their children depend upon it for such activities than YouTube without having any advertisement, or any other act that parents won’t like for their child.
